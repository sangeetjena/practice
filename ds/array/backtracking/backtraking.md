🌱 What is Backtracking?

Backtracking is a trial-and-error search technique.

👉 You try to build a solution step by step.
👉 If at some step you realize it won’t work, you go back (backtrack) and try a different option.

Think of it like exploring a maze:
Backtracking = try all possibilities (explore a search space like a tree), and backtrack when a choice fails.

You move forward.

If you hit a dead end, you go back to the last choice point and try a new path.

🔹 Steps in Backtracking

Choose → Pick an option.

Explore → Move forward with that choice.

Un-choose → If it doesn’t work, undo the choice (backtrack).
