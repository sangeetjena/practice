"""
In this problem, we have `m` cakes placed in a row on a baking sheet - eg. Cake 1, Cake 2, Cake 3, ....

- We'd like to decorate each cake either red, green, or blue.
- For each combination of cake and color, we are given the amount of money it costs to decorate that cake with that color.
- A cake cannot be decorated the same color as its neighbor cakes (left and right)
- The goal is to decorate all of the cakes for the minimum total cost.
