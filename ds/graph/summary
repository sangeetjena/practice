shortest path:
    dijkstras algorithm : this algo works both in directed and undirected graph. it will sum weight when it move to
    next vertex. so it will not work for negative edge.

MST:
definition: A spanning tree is a subset of Graph G, which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of
edges. Hence, a spanning tree does not have cycles and it cannot be disconnected..
    algorithms:
        prims algorithm (greedy algorithm): works only with undirected graph. this algorithm will not sum edge value,
        rather it will take the lowest edge value only. means same as dijkstras algo without adding previous edge value.
            time complexity:
            space complexity:
        kruskal algorithm (greedy)
